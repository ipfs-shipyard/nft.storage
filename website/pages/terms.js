          <p className='lh-copy'>It is recommended that you do not rely on Filecoin deals directly and instead you allow <a className='black' href='https://nft.storage'>nft.storage</a> to make the data available in IPFS. Retrieving data over the IPFS network is the only reliable means of accessing nft.storage data.</p>
