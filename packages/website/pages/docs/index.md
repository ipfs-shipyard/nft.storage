# Quickstart

**Ready to get started using NFT.Storage right now?** Get up and running in minutes by following this quickstart guide. In this guide, we'll walk through the following steps:

1. [Create an NFT.Storage account](#create-an-account)
1. [Uploading a file via the website](#uploading-a-file-using-the-website)
1. [Get a free API token](#get-an-api-token)
1. [Using the JavaScript API](#using-the-javascript-api)

**This guide uses Node.js since it's the fastest way to get started using the Web3.Storage JavaScript client programmatically**, but don't worry if Node isn't your favorite runtime environment â€” or if you'd rather not do any coding at all. You can also use NFT.Storage in the following ways:
- Using the JavaScript client in web browsers.
- Upload and retrieve files directly from your [Files page](https://nft.storage/files/) on the NFT.Storage website.

You can also use the [HTTP API][reference-http-api] directly using any programming language or tooling that can send HTTP requests.

:::tip
When using the HTTP API, make sure to read about [CAR files][concepts-car-files] to learn how to support large uploads!

1. Click **Create an API token**.
1. Enter a descriptive name for your API token and click **Create**.

:::warning Keep your API token private 
Do not share your API token with anyone else. This key is specific to your account.
