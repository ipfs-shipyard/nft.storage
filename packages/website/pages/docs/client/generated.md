# OpenAPI generated clients

If you're integrating NFT.Storage with a JavaScript project, the [JavaScript client][reference-js-client] is a natural fit. If JavaScript isn't part of your stack, the NFT.Storage [HTTP API][reference-http-api] can be used from any programming language capable of making HTTP requests. 

In addition to using the standard request libraries for your language, you can use client libraries generated from the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) schema that describes the API.

Generated clients are available for the following languages:

- [Go](https://github.com/nftstorage/go-client)
- [Java](https://github.com/nftstorage/java-client)
- [PHP](https://github.com/nftstorage/php-client)
- [Python](https://github.com/nftstorage/python-client)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/nftstorage/ruby-client)
- [Rust](https://github.com/nftstorage/python-client)

Please see the repository for each client library for usage details.
