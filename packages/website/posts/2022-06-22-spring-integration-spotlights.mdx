The Dvision Network is a blockchain-based NFT metaverse platform. The Dvision Network establishes a new format of metaverse ecosystem that utilizes its own VR technology and aims to lower the entry barriers for users across the globe. 

The need for a resilient system to store NFT data and mitigate the risk of data manipulation is paramount. Therefore, NFT.storage x Dvision Network integration came about to help the 2 billion gamers worldwide who have collected digital items and need the same assurances that these digital items will be protected and exist, regardless of the existence of any single institution. NFT.Storage provides data immutability for Dvision NFT metadata, enhanced data storage privacy, and better overall security. All Dvision Network NFT metadata will be stored using NFT.Storage such as LAND, PET, Avatar, and ITEM.

LimeWire is back to bring NFT collectibles to everybody\.

LimeWire aims to let everyone participate in owning and offering digital collectibles no matter the budget or tech-savviness. A key component of their vision is to make the whole process as frictionless and safe as possible for our users. LimeWire is designed as a custodial marketplace: Every user has by default a wallet for cryptocurrencies as well as digital collectibles (NFTs) that LimeWire will be hosting for them. NFTs will both be stored by us on their system, alongside NFT.Storage, creating additional layers of redundancy, and securing the storage of the NFT assets.

“The LimeWire team has been incredibly thoughtful in how to balance Web2 and Web3 - to make the benefits of NFTs accessible to creators and their audiences without forcing them to become experts on Web3 overnight. We’re excited to be partnering with them to help ensure all NFTs are stored and persisted on decentralized storage networks,” says Jonathan Victor, BD Lead at NFT.Storage.
